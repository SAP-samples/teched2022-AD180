# AD180 - Visually Build a Full-Stack Application with SAP Build Apps

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2022 session called AD180 - Visually Build a Full-Stack Application with SAP Build Apps.  

## Overview

This session introduces attendees to SAP Build Apps to create full-stack development capabilities to the next generation of citizen development: visual cloud functions. Explore the new back-end service that allows users to visually build fully functional applications in one intuitive, no-code environment, with cloud-hosted data models. We'll also take a first look into serverless business logic, and more.

## Exercises

The exercises are divided into two parts. In part one we use the new No-Code perspective of Visual Cloud Functions to create a data persistence on SAP BTP and also create a service automatically that will be consumed in the Frontend of SAP Build Apps.
